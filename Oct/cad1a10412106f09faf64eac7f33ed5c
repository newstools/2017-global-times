Qudian priced its initial public offering of 37,500,000 American depositary shares (ADSs) at 24.00 US dollars per ADS for a total offering size of approximately 900.00 million dollars, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share. Of the total 37,500,000 ADSs offered, 35,625,000 ADSs are being offered by the Company and 1,875,000 ADSs are being offered by selling shareholders. In addition, the selling shareholders have granted the underwriters an option, exercisable within 30 days from the date of the final prospectus, to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,625,000 additional ADSs to cover over-allotments.
