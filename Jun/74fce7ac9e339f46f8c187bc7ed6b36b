Illustrations: Peter C. Espina/GTRecently, a court in Beijing heard a case of intentional injury by a security guard previously working at Tsinghua University and sentenced the criminal to 13 years in prison. The criminal poured sulfuric acid onto his colleague out of dissatisfaction with being elbowed out by the latter, causing serious injuries to the victim. In recent years, crimes of passion are on the rise. What deserves attention is that the increasing offences often result from extreme emotions and behaviors over trivial affairs. It is true that the high pace of modern life has exacerbated social tensions in public life and people are sometimes unconsciously deprived of their patience under some circumstances. However, benevolence and tolerance are still thought of highly by the majority of the public and provides hope for better and more civilized life for everyone.
