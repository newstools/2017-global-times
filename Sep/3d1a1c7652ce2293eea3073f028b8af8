A former elementary school teacher's aide in eastern US state of Maryland was sentenced to 100 years in jail on Thursday for filming sexual acts with children. According to court documents, Deonte Carraway, aged 24, coerced and persuaded children aged from 9 to 13, to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce videos from October 11, 2015 through February 1, 2016. Images produced during those times include Carraway engaging in sexual activity with victims, as well as the victims engaging in sexually explicit conduct at his direction, according to local media reports. Parents of some of the victims broke down in court as Carraway apologized and told the parents, "I wish I could go back and stop myself from doing it." "I hope that this sentence ensures that you, Mr. Carraway, will never have the opportunity to harm other children again," Prince George's County Judge Beverly Woodard said. Carraway was indicted on 270 counts of sex abuse and related charges in Prince George's County last year. In January, Carraway pleaded guilty to 15 counts of child sex crimes in federal court.
