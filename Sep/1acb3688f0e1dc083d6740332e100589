A Qantas Airbus A380 flight was forced to return shortly after taking off from Dubai International Airport Wednesday morning due to a technical problem, the daily Gulf news reported. The aircraft bound for Sydney, Australia, took off at 10:20 a.m. local time (0720 GMT), Gulf news said. The Australia's biggest airline confirmed "an issue with the air conditioning system," it added, without giving information about the number of passengers and crew aboard. The UAE daily also displayed a flight path tracker indicating that the A380 aircraft circled over Dubai several times before returning to the airport. An investigation by Qantas engineers was underway, the airline said in a statement. The affected passengers were provided with accommodation in Dubai and are scheduled to fly at 11:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday.
